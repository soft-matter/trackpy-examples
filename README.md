trackpy-examples
================

This is a trove of **sample data, examples, and speed tests** for the
[trackpy particle-tracking toolkit](https://github.com/soft-matter/trackpy).
See trackpy proper for installation instructions and more information about
the project, including full documentation.

Because image and video data are large, these files are maintained here in
a separate repository.

(This was begun on 11 February 2014 and is in its early stages. But it is
being actively developed by the trackpy contributors.)
